## Current and Past Projects

### The Southern Ocean Freshwater Input from Antarctica ([SOFIA](https://sofiamip.github.io/)) Initiative
The Southern Ocean Freshwater Input from Antarctica (SOFIA) Initiative aims to improve our understanding of the simulated response to Antarctic freshwater input, and in particular the model uncertainty.
The initiative has developed an experimental protocol and is engaging with modelling groups from around the world to run this common set of experiments using a variety of coupled climate and ocean-only models. Data from this international multi-model ensemble is openly shared for analysis, and is being synthesized into a series of publications by SOFIA participants.
The initiative was started by the CliC/CLIVAR/SCAR Southern Ocean Regional Panel, is endorsed as a CLIVAR task team, and has been submitted as a community MIP to CMIP7.
