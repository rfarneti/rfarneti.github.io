## Current and Past Projects

### The Southern Ocean Freshwater Input from Antarctica ([SOFIA](https://sofiamip.github.io/)) Initiative
___
The Southern Ocean Freshwater Input from Antarctica (SOFIA) Initiative aims to improve our understanding of the simulated response to Antarctic freshwater input, and in particular the model uncertainty.
The initiative has developed an experimental protocol and is engaging with modelling groups from around the world to run this common set of experiments using a variety of coupled climate and ocean-only models. Data from this international multi-model ensemble is openly shared for analysis, and is being synthesized into a series of publications by SOFIA participants.
The initiative was started by the CliC/CLIVAR/SCAR Southern Ocean Regional Panel, is endorsed as a CLIVAR task team, and has been submitted as a community MIP to CMIP7.

### Flux-anomaly-forced model intercomparison project ([FAFMIP](http://www.fafmip.org/))
___
FAFMIP is an atmosphere-ocean general circulation model intercomparison project of CMIP6, initiated in 2016. Its purpose is to investigate the model spread in AOGCM projections of ocean climate change forced by CO2 increase. This spread is due to the different AOGCMs' differing simulations of regional ocean density and circulation changes, especially in high latitudes and the North Atlantic.

[Ocean-only FAFMIP]( https://doi.org/10.1029/2019MS002027) uses a novel design of ocean general circulation model (OGCM) experiments to investigate the ocean's response to surface buoyancy and momentum flux perturbations without atmosphere-ocean feedbacks.

([Navarro-Labastida, R., R. Farneti (2023)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2023.1208052); [Narayanasetti et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-022-06224-1); [Todd et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019MS002027))

### Co-ordinated Ocean-Ice Reference Experiments ([CORE](https://www.clivar.org/omdp/core))
___
Ocean-ice model experiments are useful since they are less costly than fully coupled experiments, they can be used in hindcast mode to reproduce the history of ocean and ice variables and hence help in the interpretation of observations, they allow for the understanding of processes in the absence of biases introduced by the atmospheric model and hence potentially give superior representations (compared to the ocean component of a coupled model) of key physical, chemical and biological processes and so help in model development.

Both CORE-I and CORE-II simulations provide a framework to evaluate ocean model performance, to study mechanisms of ocean phenomena and their variability from seasonal to decadal timescales, to identify forced variability changes, and to develop mechanistic descriptions of observed climate variability and change.

### JRA-55 based surface dataset for driving ocean-sea ice models ([JRA55-do](https://climate.mri-jma.go.jp/pub/ocean/JRA55-do/index.html))
___
JRA55-do (Tsujino et al., 2018) is a surface dataset for driving ocean-sea ice models and used in phase 2 of OMIP (OMIP-2).

I have written some notes on how to use JRA55-do in MOM5 [here](https://mom-ocean.github.io/assets/pdfs/MOM5_JRA55do.pdf).
