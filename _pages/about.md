I am physical oceanographer interested in the role of the ocean in climate variability, predictability and change. For my research, I use and develop a suite of ocean and coupled climate models mainly based on the [GFDL/MOM](https://github.com/mom-ocean) model. My research spans a broad range of topics including Southern Ocean physics and dynamics, Atlantic Ocean interannual to decadal variability, Pacific decadal variability and regional dynamics of the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean. 

I obtained my PhD in physical oceanography at University of Southampton / National Oceanography Centre. I then moved to Princeton University / GFDL, NOAA and presently I am a Research Scientist in the Earth System Physics section of [ICTP](https://www.ictp.it/esp).

Since 2015, I coordinate the Earth System Physics Diploma Programme, where I teach Geophysical Fluid Dynamics and Physics and Dynamics of the Ocean. I am also a member of the Academic Board of the PhD Program in Earth Science, Fluid Dynamics and Mathematics at the [University of Trieste](https://web.units.it/dottorato/esfm/).

Since at ICTP, I co-organized around 20 Workshops and Schools both in Trieste and abroad, including Ecuador, India, Argentina, Turkey, Guatemala and Ghana.

Between 2018-2020 I served as co-Chair of the WCRP [CLIVAR/CliC/SCAR Southern Ocean Regional Panel](https://www.clivar.org/clivar-panels/southern). Since 2021 I serve as Topical Editor for the EGU Journal [Geoscientific Model Development (GMD)](https://www.geoscientific-model-development.net/).

## Forthcoming Schools & Workshops
