I am physical oceanographer interested in the role of the ocean in climate variability, predictability and change. For my research, I use and develop a suite of ocean and coupled climate models, from global to regional. My research spans a broad range of topics including Southern Ocean physics and dynamics, Atlantic Ocean interannual to decadal variability, Pacific decadal variability and regional dynamics of the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean. 

I obtained my PhD in physical oceanography at University of Southampton / National Oceanography Centre, UK under the supervision of Peter Killworth. I then moved to Princeton University / GFDL, NOAA and presently I am a Research Scientist in the Earth System Physics section of [ICTP](https://www.ictp.it/).

Since 2015, I coordinate the Earth System Physics Diploma Programme, where I teach Geophysical Fluid Dynamics and Physics and Dynamics of the Ocean. I am also a member of the Academic Board of the PhD Program in Earth Science, Fluid Dynamics and Mathematics at the [University of Trieste](https://web.units.it/dottorato/esfm/).

Since at ICTP, I co-organized around 20 Workshops and Schools both in Trieste and abroad, including Ecuador, India, Argentina, Turkey, Guatemala and Ghana.

Between 2018-2020 I served as co-Chair of the WCRP CLIVAR/CliC/SCAR Southern Ocean Regional Panel. Since 2021 I serve as Topical Editor for the EGU Journal Geoscientific Model Development (GMD).


A data-driven personal website
======



Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
